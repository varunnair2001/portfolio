                <p>The Charles River Center (CRC) in Needham, Massachusetts, is a day habilitation center that
                    supports individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The Center serves nearly
                    150 residents and is staffed by over 60 professionals, organized into three key departments:
                </p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1) Residential Staff: Manage residents’ daily living needs, including sleep routines, morning
                            and evening meals, and medication schedules.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2) Rehabilitation Staff: Support residents in engaging with activities such as laundry,
                            cooking, games, Zumba, karaoke, and community outings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3) Leadership Team: Oversee organizational strategy, task coordination, and operational
                            management.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>Together, these teams aim to foster an environment that prioritizes well-being, dignity, and
                    independence for every resident.</p><br>

                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Our Focus</p>
                <p>As human factors engineering and engineering psychology students, we aim to enhance user experience
                    and safety by eliciting knowledge from and about target users, identifying systemic inefficiencies,
                    and designing thoughtful, human-centered solutions. Through our initial research, we decided to
                    focus our project on problems related to healthcare delivery and interpersonal communication within
                    the context of disability support services at CRC. We identified the following key challenges
                    related to this problem space:</p>

                </div>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 4em;">Motivated by these gaps, we set out to understand the risks, errors, and
                    root causes of these
                    communication breakdowns. Our goal was to design a solution that not only streamlines communication
                    and task management but also promotes inclusive practices and better documentation of resident
                    participation, engagement, and progress.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">User Research</p>
                <p>Objective - We aimed to identify the challenges that staff members at CRC face when coordinating
                    care, communicating across roles, and supporting residents with intellectual and developmental
                    disabilities in their daily routines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Research Approach - To explore this question, we adopted a human-centered, ethnographic approach
                    grounded in human factors research. Our methods included:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. Site Visits and Ethnographic Observation - Multiple visits to CRC allowed us to observe staff in
                    their work environments, including real-time coordination, interruptions, and how emergencies were
                    handled.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Stakeholder Interviews - We conducted semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of
                    stakeholders:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>a) Kevin Salera, Chief Operating Officer (Leadership)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>b) Caitlin Louis, Head Nurse (Residential Staff)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>c) Althea Hobson, Co-Assistant Program Director (Rehabilitation Staff)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>d) Peter Dedon, Parent of Resident
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Each interview was tailored with role-specific questions to surface
                    nuanced insights. This allowed us
                    to understand not just what wasn’t working, but why it was difficult for each group in their
                    context.</p><br>

                </figure>
                <p>3. Whiteboard Ideation and Mind Mapping - After our initial fieldwork and interviews, we held a
                    whiteboard ideation session to map key findings and start clustering them into themes. This helped
                    us see where problems overlapped across staff categories (e.g., onboarding, task tracking,
                    resident-specific knowledge gaps). We made a mind map to visually group concerns and organize our
                    ideas with CRC’s communication gaps, allowing patterns to emerge organically and guiding our
                    solution design process.

                <p>As part of our user research at CRC, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders
                    across residential, rehabilitation, leadership staff, and a family member of a resident. Each
                    interview was tailored to the participant’s role, with questions focused on daily workflows,
                    communication challenges, emergency handling, onboarding practices, and perceptions of resident
                    engagement. Included below is the question guide for our interviews with residential staff. </p><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1. Communication between and within residential, rehabilitation, and leadership staff isn’t
                            always smooth. People rely on walkie-talkies, text threads, or paper logs, and things often
                            fall through the cracks, especially during emergencies or shift changes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2. New staff often feel lost during onboarding. There’s no simple way to get to know each
                            resident’s unique needs, and most learning happens on the job, which can be risky for more
                            medically complex or non-verbal residents.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3. Families want to feel more connected. Many told us they hear about issues too late, and
                            would love more regular updates—not just in emergencies, but on the small positive things
                            their loved ones do each day.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>4. Staff deeply care, but they’re stretched thin. Most wish they had more time and support to
                            engage residents in meaningful activities instead of just focusing on basic caregiving.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>5. Everyone’s trying their best, but the current systems make it hard to keep everyone
                            informed, coordinated, and truly centered on the residents’ growth and independence.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 4em;">Our Solution</p>
                <p>Design Description - To address the communication and coordination challenges uncovered in our
                    research, we designed a tablet-based application: a lightweight, centralized communication and
                    task-tracking platform tailored for the unique environment of CRC. It acts as a digital hub that
                    brings together residential staff, rehabilitation staff, leadership, and family members, each with
                    custom access and permissions based on their role. (Please note that the following images and links
                    reflect the final version of our solution, while later sections in this report discuss the rationale
                    for iteration.)</p>

                <p>*Note: the prototype involves only the staff member features. Due to the high importance of the staff
                    communication challenges and resource constraints, the prototype does not extend to leadership- and
                    family-facing versions; these two versions were instead tested as concepts discussed with end users.
                    With more time, leadership and family sides of the platform would be developed and tested with a
                    similar procedure as the one for the staff version, described as follows.</p><br>
                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Task Analysis & Risk Analysis</p>
                <p>With our concept prototyped in sufficient fidelity to garner useful feedback, we conducted a task
                    analysis of our envisioned use cases of the solution. We focused on the staff-facing version of the
                    platform, as it was the most fleshed out of the three conceived versions. Once we described all
                    associated tasks, we identified potential use errors and assessed them for severity and likelihood
                    to determine the overall risks of our solution. To view the complete task analysis and corresponding
                    risk analysis, please refer to the spreadsheet linked below. The table outlines key user tasks,
                    associated use errors, hazards, and potential harms, along with severity and probability ratings,
                    calculated risk levels, and mitigation strategies.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>1. Added visual indicators like priority, room number, and due time to help staff quickly
                            understand what needs attention and when.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>2. Included resident photos and a short description or note (e.g., preferred name, key
                            considerations) to avoid mix-ups and support more personalized care.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3. There are built-in task-specific instructions, so no one has to guess what “help with
                            lunch” actually means for a particular resident.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>5. Made it so staff must review and confirm each action (like toileting assistance or
                            feeding) before it’s logged to ensure everything is accurate.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>6. Designed the platform to require checklist completion before allowing a task summary to be
                            submitted. That way, nothing gets forgotten in a rush.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>7. Ensured sensitive actions (like emergency reporting or medication support) now come with a
                            final prompt to double-check everything before it’s sent.
                        </p>

                <p>Test Protocol - This usability test focuses on evaluating the early-stage prototype of our
                    communication and task-tracking platform designed for CRC. The goal is to assess how effectively the
                    prototype supports real-life care coordination, communication, and resident engagement across staff
                    roles. Participants will interact with a rehabilitation and residential-facing version of the
                    platform using the clickable Figma prototype. The prototype emphasizes core workflows such as task
                    completion, emergency communication, and resident information access.

                <p>Subjective Feedback -</p>
                <p>Participants responded positively to the platform’s simplicity and ease of use. The calendar layout
                    felt familiar, and staff appreciated features like task tracking, updates, and the potential to
                    improve communication between teams. The SOS alert was seen as a useful addition, and users felt it
                    could save time in emergencies if implemented well.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the same time, users shared several suggestions. They wanted the SOS button to be more visible
                    (e.g., red with a clear label), with options to categorize emergencies and add follow-up notes.
                    Other “nice-to-haves” included personalized care videos, task icons, flexible due times, the ability
                    to log notes for all residents (not just those who didn’t participate), and more visibility into
                    residents’ preferences and routines. Families liked the idea of photo galleries but expressed
                    privacy concerns.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, users felt the platform had strong potential to streamline care, boost accountability, and
                    foster more meaningful engagement, both with residents and their families.</p>

                <p>Next Steps -</p>
                <p>If we were to continue this project, our immediate next steps would include conducting additional
                    rounds of usability testing with a broader range of CRC staff, including new hires, part-time
                    workers, and overnight residential staff, to ensure the platform supports all user needs and work
                    contexts.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We would also begin developing higher-fidelity prototypes of the leadership and family-facing views,
                    incorporating role-specific functionality and access levels. In parallel, we would collaborate with
                    CRC's IT team and compliance teams to evaluate data privacy, consent management, and integration
                    feasibility with existing systems. Lastly, we’d work closely with staff trainers to design
                    onboarding materials and explore lightweight training modules to support adoption.</p>
                <br>
                <p>CRC has expressed interest in including this project in a report to support grant funding efforts
                    aimed at hiring developers and continuing the application buildout. Alternatively, we may explore
                    passing this project off to a student team or organization at Tufts for further development and
                    implementation in the coming semester(s). </p>

                <p>Conclusion -</p>
                <p>This project allowed us to explore how thoughtful, role-specific design can improve communication in
                    a high-responsibility care environment.
                    CRC’s new platform was shaped by direct input from staff and families, and while still a prototype,
                    it reflects a promising step toward reducing friction, improving transparency, and centering
                    resident dignity and participation in every interaction.
