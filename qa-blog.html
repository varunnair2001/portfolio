                        </figure>
                        <p>Quality Assurance entails multiple activities, processes, and methodologies designed to
                            preemptively tackle defects and guarantee that the product or service surpasses customer
                            expectations. QA takes a proactive stance, prioritizing the prevention of issues rather than
                            merely identifying and rectifying them later in the development cycle.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Key Characteristics of Quality Assurance</p>
                        <p>1. Process-Oriented: QA is concerned with establishing and implementing standardized
                            processes and procedures throughout the development lifecycle. These processes aim to
                            minimize the occurrence of defects by enforcing best practices, guidelines, and standards.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2. Prevention: QA focuses on identifying potential issues early in the development process
                            and implementing measures to prevent their occurrence. It involves thorough planning, risk
                            assessment, and proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure the product's quality.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3. Objective: QA activities are objective-driven, aiming to ensure that the product adheres
                            to predefined quality criteria and meets the specified requirements. It involves defining
                            quality metrics and establishing benchmarks to assess the product's performance against
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>4. Responsibility: QA is a collective responsibility shared by the entire development team.
                            Each team member contributes to maintaining quality standards by following established
                            processes, conducting reviews, and providing feedback.

                        </figure>
                        <p>Quality Control refers to the set of activities and techniques that focus on identifying
                            defects and deviations from quality standards during the development process. QC is a
                            reactive approach that emphasizes the detection and correction of defects to ensure the
                            final product's conformance to quality requirements.</p>

                        <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Key Characteristics of Quality Control</p>
                        <p>1. Product-Oriented: QC concentrates on the product, examining its characteristics, features,
                            and performance against predetermined quality standards. It inspects, tests, and analyzes to
                            identify deviations from expected outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2. Detection: QC activities identify defects and deviations from quality standards through
                            various techniques such as inspections, walkthroughs, and testing. It involves an
                            examination of the product to uncover any issues that may impact its quality.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3. Corrective Action: QC assumes a pivotal role after defect identification, fully committed
                            to implementing corrective measures to tackle the identified issues. It involves a range of
                            activities such as debugging, undertaking rework, or implementing essential modifications to
                            the product. The ultimate goal is to eradicate the identified flaws and restore the product
                            to conformity with the established quality requirements.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>4. Accountability: QC is primarily the responsibility of dedicated quality control personnel
                            or teams. They are responsible for conducting inspections, running tests, and analyzing
                            results to ensure the product meets the specified quality criteria.

                        </figure>
                        <p>While QA and QC share the common goal of achieving product quality, several factors
                            differentiate the two:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1. Focus: QA focuses on preventing defects, while QC focuses on identifying and fixing
                            defects during development. QA aims to establish robust processes, guidelines, and standards
                            to minimize the occurrence of defects, whereas QC concentrates on evaluating the product
                            against quality standards to detect and rectify errors.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2. Timing: QA activities start at the beginning of the development lifecycle and continue
                            throughout the process, ensuring quality adherence from the outset. On the other hand, QC
                            activities occur during specific stages or after product development, aiming to detect and
                            rectify defects.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>3. Proactive versus Reactive: QA is naturally proactive, emphasizing prevention and risk
                            mitigation, while QC is reactive, aiming to detect and correct issues after they occur. QA
                            focuses on identifying potential risks and implementing measures to mitigate them, while QC
                            focuses on identifying and addressing issues that are already existing.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>4. Responsibility: QA is a shared responsibility among all team members, who contribute to
                            maintaining quality standards by following established processes and providing feedback. In
                            contrast, QC is often the responsibility of dedicated quality control personnel or teams who
                            conduct inspections, testing, and analysis.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>5. Approach: QA is process-oriented, focusing on establishing and following standardized
                            processes and procedures. It aims to prevent defects through careful planning, risk
                            assessment, and adherence to best practices. However, QC is product-oriented, evaluating the
                            product's characteristics and performance against quality standards. It involves
                            inspections, testing, and corrective actions.

                        <p>Product quality assurance and quality control are fundamental aspects of the quality
                            management process, collaborating synergistically to uphold the standard of products. While
                            quality assurance primarily emphasizes the prevention of defects through establishing
                            resilient tasks and standards, quality control concentrates on identifying and resolving
                            defects during the development phase. Both QA and QC play vital roles in ensuring product
                            quality, and a harmonious integration of their activities can substantially elevate the
                            overall quality of products and services provided to customers. By comprehending the
                            distinctions between QA and QC, organizations can devise effective strategies for quality
                            management, fostering an environment of continual improvement and customer satisfaction.</p>
