                <p><i>Patients requiring tube feeding will typically go to the hospital at least once in 6 months
                        due to feeding-related complications.</i></p><br>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 4em;">Feeding tube misadministration poses a serious risk to patient safety,
                    particularly for adults
                    with dysphagia who may be non-verbal and unable to communicate distress. MAP-trained staff and
                    caregivers without medical backgrounds often lack structured training, resulting in low
                    confidence and increased risk of errors. These errors can lead to complications like aspiration
                    pneumonia, infections, and hospitalization.</p>
                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">A Primer on G-Tube Safety</p>
                <p>G-tube feeding is a vital part of care for individuals who cannot safely eat or swallow, most often
                    due to conditions like dysphagia. A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is typically used when long-term
                    enteral feeding is required, as opposed to short-term options like nasogastric or orogastric tubes.
                </p><br>
                <p>While essential for maintaining nutrition and hydration, G-tube feeding carries certain risks. Common
                    issues arise from insufficient caregiver training, poor hygiene during setup, skipping key safety
                    steps (which can result in the MIC-KEY button becoming detached), or overfeeding, when more formula
                    is administered than the body can safely process.</p><br>
                <figure class="bottom_60">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Images/gtube1.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                    <span class="blog-info top_15 bottom_30">PEG-tubes (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) per 100,000
                        in the US</span>
                </figure>
                <p>Aspiration remains one of the most serious complications. Many individuals with feeding tubes are
                    hospitalized at least once due to feeding-related incidents. Aspiration can occur during or after a
                    feed, if formula is not properly digested, it can reflux into the airway, restricting oxygen flow
                    and quickly becoming a medical emergency.</p><br>
                <p>We partnered closely with the Charles River Center (CRC), an adult day habilitation program in
                    Needham, Massachusetts, which supports around 80 residents daily, many of whom have intellectual and
                    developmental disabilities. Staff at CRC manage a wide range of care routines, including medication,
                    rehabilitation, and feeding. Among these, administering G-tube feeds via the MIC-KEY button is one
                    of the most critical and high-risk tasks.</p><br>
                <p>The challenge is made more complex by the fact that many residents are non-verbal. They may be unable
                    to express discomfort or signal when something is wrong. In such cases, tools like pulse oximeters
                    become essential, often providing the first warning signs of aspiration by detecting drops in oxygen
                    saturation within minutes. Beyond aspiration, additional risks, such as infection, tube dislodgment,
                    and overfeeding, are often linked to improper feeding pressure or skipped steps in the routine.</p>

                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Target Users</p>
                <p>Our project focuses on the needs of two core groups of non-clinical G-tube administrators:
                    MAP-certified staff in care facilities and family caregivers supporting loved ones at home. These
                    individuals often play a central role in administering G-tube feeds, yet they receive limited
                    training and support.</p><br>
                <p>We were particularly guided by the voices of users like Kim and Hilary. Their stories reflect a
                    broader issue: most caregivers rely on outdated, verbal, or paper-based instructions that are
                    difficult to retain, especially in high-stress situations.</p><br>
                <p>By designing a training intervention that addresses their needs, clarity, confidence, and
                    repeatability, we aim to empower caregivers to deliver safe, effective care.</p><br>

                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">Our Solution - A Training Kit to Build Confidence</p>
                <p>Our project proposes a structured training program designed to reduce feeding tube accidents by
                    improving <strong>knowledge retention, procedural adherence, and situational awareness</strong>
                    among administers.
                </p><br>
                <p>Our solution is a structured G-tube training kit, designed to reduce feeding-related errors through
                    hands-on repetition. It includes a pressure-sensitive syringe, a realistic MIC-KEY training pad, a
                    G-tube safety checklist, and a visual IFU. All elements are designed to simulate real scenarios
                    while providing immediate feedback, so users build both skill and confidence.
                </p><br>
                <p>To create a smooth and intuitive learning experience, the G-tube training kit is thoughtfully
                    organized into four clearly labeled drawers. Each drawer represents a specific stage in the G-tube
                    placement and care process, guiding the learner step-by-step in a logical, hands-on progression.
                    This structured approach not only builds confidence but also ensures that essential skills are
                    mastered in the correct order, making the training both effective and easy to follow
                </p><br>

                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">1. Clear Directions</p>
                <p>We started with the basics, reducing decision-making during critical moments.
                </p>
                <p>The G-tube Safety Checklist is designed as a quick-reference, step-by-step guide that caregivers can
                    follow at a glance. By clearly outlining each step in the G-tube care process, it significantly
                    reduces cognitive load, especially in moments of stress, urgency, or emotional overwhelm, when
                    recalling steps from memory can become challenging. This checklist acts as a calming, reliable
                    companion, helping caregivers stay focused and confident during feeding procedures.
                </p><br>
                <figure class="bottom_60" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Images/gtube13.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>Complementing the checklist is our thoughtfully designed 'Instructions for Use' booklet. This guide
                    organizes the entire kit visually, using clearly labeled diagrams, intuitive icons, and minimal
                    text, allowing users to easily identify the necessary components and follow instructions without
                    extensive reading. Whether a caregiver is new to G-tube feeding or needs a quick refresher, this
                    visual approach ensures accessibility and ease of use.
                </p><br>
                <p>Together, these tools create a supportive system for caregivers, one that acknowledges the real-world
                    pressures they face while trying to provide safe, effective care. By reducing confusion and
                    streamlining the process, we aim to empower caregivers to focus less on logistics and more on what
                    matters most: the comfort and well-being of the person they’re caring for."
                </p><br>

                <p class="blog-title" style="font-size: 20px;">2. A Safe Space for Learning</p>
                <p>A huge contributor to cognitive overload is a lack of hands-on familiarity. Caregivers often handle a
                    MIC-KEY button for the first time during real patient care. To fix that, we included this realistic
                    injection pad, fitted with an actual MIC-KEY button and extension tubing. It allows users to safely
                    repeat core steps like connecting, securing, and flushing until they build muscle memory. This
                    practice reduces hesitation and helps caregivers feel more prepared when it matters most.

                <p>Here, we address one of the most invisible, but significant sources of cognitive load in G-tube
                    feeding: judging the correct amount of pressure to apply. Caregivers are often left uncertain,
                    wondering how much force is too much when pushing formula through the tube. </p><br>
                <figure class="bottom_60" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/Images/gtube17.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>Our innovative pressure-sensing syringe system eliminates the guesswork by providing real-time visual
                    feedback. As the caregiver administers the feed, a connected digital display guides them with a
                    simple yet effective color-coded system: green indicates the ‘safe zone,’ yellow signals a ‘warning’
                    that the pressure is increasing, and red provides an immediate ‘danger’ alert if force becomes
                    excessive. This intuitive interface allows users to self-correct in the moment, without relying on
                    prior experience or verbal cues.</p><br>
                <figure class="bottom_60" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">

                </figure>
                <p>By transforming a subtle and often anxiety-inducing task into a clear, visual experience, we make
                    learning and performing G-tube feeding safer, easier, and more empowering, especially for new
                    caregivers or those operating under stress. Importantly, all visual signage and alerts on the device
                    adhere to ANSI Z535 standards for safety colors and labeling. </p><br>
                <p>This ensures high visibility, consistent interpretation, and alignment with established best
                    practices for safety communication in medical environments.</p><br>

                        <p>1. <strong>Empowering the User:</strong> This project reinforced the importance of co-design
                            and participatory
                            design. By involving caregivers and staff in the process, we were able to create tools that
                            addressed real needs, not assumed ones.</p>

                        <p>2. <strong>Build Early + “Fail” Early:</strong> Rapid prototyping helped us test ideas early
                            and often. We
                            learned how to strike a balance between prototype fidelity and simplicity, avoiding
                            distractions that come with over-engineering.</p>

                        <p>3. <strong>No Such Thing as Linear:</strong> Design is rarely straightforward. This process
                            taught us that
                            while the steps may be iterative and unpredictable, they are still far less complex than
                            human emotion and behavior, which we must always consider.</p>
